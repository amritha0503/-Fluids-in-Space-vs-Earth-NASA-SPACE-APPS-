🌍💧Fluids in Space vs Earth

An Interactive Educational Web Platform Comparing Fluid Behavior on Earth and in Space

🚀 Overview

Fluids in Space vs Earth is an interactive web application that helps students explore how fluids such as water, oil, and colloids behave under Earth’s gravity (1g) versus microgravity (0g) conditions — inspired by real NASA Colloid and Marangoni Convection experiments.

The project visualizes the differences in fluid motion, surface tension, and convection through interactive sliders and real-time simulations.
It’s a perfect STEM outreach and educational tool that makes fluid physics fun and visual.


🎯 Goal

To make learning about microgravity fluid physics accessible and engaging by:

Demonstrating how fluids move and form shapes in zero gravity.

Using real scientific data to drive meaningful visualizations.

Helping students understand why fluid handling in space is challenging for astronauts.
